# How it's supposed to be solves:

* You should use the bash script to help us. Using ./ltdis.sh static will make two files - one assembly code of the file ? and another one is the strings within the static file.
in the strings file that it produces the flag hides.

#  How I solved it:

* First thing I did was using the strings, so I could find it without using the bash file.

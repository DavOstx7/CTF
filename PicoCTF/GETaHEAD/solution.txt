# It was recommended to use Burpsuite, but I wanted to use curl because it doesn't use GUI.

# At first I tried to use dirsearch, and ffuf to find hidden directories but it didn't work.

# Because the name of the problem is GET aHEAD, we need to use the HEAD request, which can be done by using curl --head <url>

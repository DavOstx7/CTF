# I connected via ssh to the endpoint in which is in the website.

#Then I did ls, to find flag1 out of 3.
#Then I moved to root using 'cd /', and using ls I found flag2 out of 3.
#Then I moved to the home directory using 'cd ~', and using ls I found flag3 out of 3.
#I used cat to display each one, and then added them to get the final result.

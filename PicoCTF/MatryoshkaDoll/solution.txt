* I looked at the hint which says files can be hidden inside files (specifically photos) so I googled it and found about Steganography.
~ Then I found that in order to hide a directory in an image, you can do: cat {image} {zip file which contains secret files} > {new encrypted image}
~ In order to view the hidden directory/files, you can do: unzip {encrypted image}

# I saw that running the program gives me nothing, so I checked the code.
# In the code, I found a secret var which is encoded, and also founda  rot47 decoder function.
* encode and decode are the same operation in the ROT cipher family.
The reason rot47 encode and decode is the same because it switches the current char to the char which is 47 steps to the right, 
and because there is a totall of 94 chars (94/2 = 47), another movement of the encrypted char will make it 94 so it will loop.

# Something cool to see was that:
* instead of doing:
index = ...
new_index = index + 47
if(new_index > 94):
	new_index-=94

* you could do this:
index = ...
new_index = (index + 47) % 94 

# Then I run the program on the secret var to decoded and I got the original var which is the key!

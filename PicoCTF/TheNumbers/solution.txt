# I tried all sort of things on the image that didn't work
# The I opened the image and saw numbers and "{ }" which made me think that the numbers were picoCTF{...}
# I tried to try all of the base conversion's to decimal and then making it an ASCII char and it didn't work
# Then I saw the hint which said the format was PICOCTF{...}
# I then looked at the number's and saw that all of them are under 26 which looked to me like a representation of the order of alphabat,
so I checked if 16 is P, 9 is I, and understood that I was right.
# Then I made a python script which translates the numbers (numbers = order of alphabet) to the alphabet caps-lock chars, which gives the flag.

# The solution is written within the solve.py code as comments.

* But as summary: 
1. We used second padding (Which is using all of the key, untill it reaches the starting point again)
2. We encrypted a string of our choice (with the same length of the flag) with the secoond padding, meaning same key values as on the flag.
3. We got the encrypted value of our string, and then extracted the key values for it.
4. We used the key values that we found to decrypt the encrypted flag (by extracting the ord(char) and then turning it to chars)
